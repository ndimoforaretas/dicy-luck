# Dicy-Luck

## Description:

Dicy Luck is a two-player game where participants can roll a dice to accumulate points.

- Players must strategize between rolling the dice to increase their current score or passing their turn to secure their accumulated points.
- The game provides a visual interface showing the score, current score, and number of throws left for each player.

## Features:

1. **Two-player Interface:** Each player has a dedicated section showing their name, score, current score, and the number of throws left.
2. **Dice Rolling:** Players can roll a dice to add points to their current score.
3. **Score Tracking:** The game keeps a cumulative tally of each player's secured points.
4. **Throws Counter:** Each player has a limited number of throws, and the game displays the remaining throws.
5. **Overlay Messages:** The game uses an overlay to show important messages, such as the winner of the game or instructions.
6. **Player Switch function:** Players can pass their turn to the other player, securing their current score.

## JavaScript Techniques:

1. **DOM Manipulation:** The game heavily utilizes DOM manipulation to select, update, and modify elements based on game events.
2. **Strict Mode:** The game's JavaScript is written in "strict mode", ensuring a safer and bug-reduced environment.
3. **Event Handling:** The game likely uses event listeners to handle user interactions like dice rolls and passing turns (this is inferred and might require a deeper look into the script).
4. **Conditional Logic:** The game rules and flow are governed by conditional logic, determining scores, winners, and game progress.
